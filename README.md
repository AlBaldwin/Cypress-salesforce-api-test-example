# Cypress-salesforce-api-test-example

This is an example of a POC I have worked on to migrate an api framework from postman to Cyprss.

In this example I have set up API calls to: 

- Get access token
- Create firm/account
- Create contact
- Create oportunity
- Link oportunity to the contact 
- Create products/subscriptions
- Run assignment logic
- Data clean up

Iterating through data using fixtures (json object)
